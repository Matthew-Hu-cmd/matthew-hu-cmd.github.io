I'm currently a master’s student at the School of Automation, Southeast University in Nanjing. <img src="./images/SEU_logo_text.png" style="width: 6em; height: auto;">

I hold a bachelor’s degree from the Excellence Engineer Program (卓越工程师班) at Chongqing University’s School of Automation, where I ranked 5th out of 232 students and earned my postgraduate admission without examination (推荐免试研究生). I also participated in the STEM program at Oxford Prospects and Global Development Institute. I am fluent in English (IELTS speaking 7.5) with strong communication skills in both academic and professional settings. <img src="./images/CQU_logo_text.png" style="width: 6em; height: auto;">

I have extensive experience in robotic development and won a national first prize in a major competition. Additionally, I participated in a university-industry collaboration project with Alibaba Group <img src="./images/alibaba-text.png" style="width: 6em; height: auto;"> , contributing to the development of AI model for fashion industry (image editing, text-image retrieval).

As part of my research, I'm working on visual camouflage scene understanding and have designed an efficient camouflage object segmentation model. I am currently exploring the use of text-image multimodal prompts to generate camouflage images that closely resemble natural scenes.

I am pursuing internship opportunities that will enable me to explore the interaction between AI systems and the real world (eg., LLM agents, embodied AI, etc.).
